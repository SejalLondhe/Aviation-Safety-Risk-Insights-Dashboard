# Aviation-Safety-Risk-Insights-Dashboard
This interactive dashboard helps visualize global flight risks, technical trends, and alerts. 

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize global flight risk, safety, and technical performance. The dashboard helps in monitoring key aviation metrics like high-risk flights, alerts, technical indicators, and flight status patterns in a simple and interactive format.

It provides insights for better understanding of aviation safety trends, risk levels, and potential technical issues based on simulated flight data.

## 🔍 Key Features
✔ Total Flights and High-Risk Flights overview

✔ Alerts breakdown by Continent and Risk Level (High, Medium, Low)

✔ Flight Status filter (On Time, Delayed, Cancelled) for focused analysis

✔ Technical trends after takeoff — Cabin Pressure, Vibration Level & Engine Temperature

✔ High-Risk Flights by Weather Condition

✔ Monthly trend of High-Risk Flights

✔ Interactive filtering by Flight Status and Continent

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a combination of:

Publicly available aviation data from Kaggle

AI-generated synthetic data to simulate realistic flight risk scenarios

The dataset is created purely for learning, analysis, and demonstration purposes. It does not contain confidential or sensitive real-world data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop

DAX Calculations

Data Cleaning and Transformation

Data Visualization & Storytelling

## 📈 How This Dashboard is Helpful
This dashboard provides a quick, interactive view of flight safety conditions. It helps:

✔ Identify which continents or regions have more alerts

✔ Understand the severity of alerts with risk level breakdown

✔ Track technical indicators after takeoff for early issue detection

✔ Spot patterns in high-risk flights by month and weather conditions

✔ Filter flights by status (On Time, Delayed, Cancelled) for focused insights

It showcases how aviation data can be transformed into meaningful visual reports to support safety and performance analysis.

## 🔧 Disclaimer
This dashboard was created as a personal project to explore Power BI and dashboard design. The data used is a mix of publicly available aviation data (Kaggle) and AI-generated samples for demonstration purposes only.
